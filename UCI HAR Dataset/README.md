## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

#As compliance with the Course Project, the following were the steps indicated:

#Create one R script all run_analysis.R with the following content:

#1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
   for each measurement.
#3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
   set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# How to make the project works
# 1. The downloaded file contains data sets as provided on the instruction
     was placed into a folder of local files of the data files.
# 2. Set the working directory on the selected local file.
# 3. Save the run_analysis.R script on the folder UCI HAR Data set placed
     on the local file.
# 4. Run source("run_analysis.R") in order to generate a new file tiny_data
     the working directory as a result of the tidy data of the course project.
